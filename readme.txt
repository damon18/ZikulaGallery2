In the spirit of "Why re-invent the wheel?" This module allows Zikula to use the most powerful open source image gallery program. In development for many years, with a strong development community, Menalto Gallery 2 is far beyond the capabilities of a simple Zikula image gallery module.

This bridge aims to bring the power of Menalto Gallery to Zikula.

mGallery2 was originally built for Postnuke .726 in 2005 and changes were made to keep it working for Zikula. The files here were taken from a live Zikula 1.2.7 site running mGallery2 to bridge to Gallery 2.3.2. There are many parts of the integration that do not work but even with all the problems it can be used to embed a Gallery into Zikula and allow users to upload pictures and text.

Helpful information and history.
